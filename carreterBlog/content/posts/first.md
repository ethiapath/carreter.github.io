# HELLO!


## LATEX??

$$C_p[\ce{H2O(l)}] : \pu{75.3 J // mol K}$$


```
$$
```
is the delimiter to start latex equations

refer to `layout/partials/math.html` for some config.
Also check out the [docs](https://gohugo.io/content-management/mathematics/#engines)


This is an inline \(a^*=x-b^*\) equation.

These are block equations:

\[a^*=x-b^*\]

\[ a^*=x-b^* \]

\[
a^*=x-b^*
\]

These are block equations using alternate delimiters:

$$a^*=x-b^*$$

$$ a^*=x-b^* $$

$$
a^*=x-b^*
$$
